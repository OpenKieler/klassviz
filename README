Building
--------

To build KlassViz, make sure you have Maven installed. Change into the
build directory and execute

  mvn clean package


Nightly Builds
--------------

Automatic builds are done every night by the KIELER Bamboo build system:

  http://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/bamboo

The resulting nightly update sites are available here:

Releases
--------

There are no official releases, only the nightly builds. With our development
model, we try to ensure that only stable code gets into the master branch
that is built each night.


Development
-----------

Our development process is quite easy: the master branch is supposed to
always be stable. All development takes place in feature branches. Once a
feature is deemed stable enough, the code is merged into the master branch
and thus gets shipped through the nightly builds.
